# [APT33](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0064/)
## Initial Access
### Spearphishing Link
APT33 has sent spearphishing emails containing links to .hta files.[\[1\]](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html)[\[3\]](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)

In a 2017 attack against the Aerospace (particularly in the US) and Energy sectors, APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry. The emails included recruitment themed lures and contained links to malicious .hta files. The .hta files contained job descriptions and links to legitimate job postings on popular employment websites that would be relevant to the targeted individuals.[\[1\]](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html)

#### Detection Methods
Look for links to external locations that end in `.hta`.  Just because it doesn't end in `.hta` doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't an HTA though.  Look for MSHTA.exe activity.  Be prepared for a lot of false positives, there are legitimate uses of `.hta` files, particularly by HP printers.  A method for whittling away some of the false positives is to look for MSHTA.exe files that contain scripts, particularly those that use VBScript and contain `WScript`.

### Spearphishing Attachment
APT33 has sent spearphising emails with malicious attachments to potential victims.[\[3\]](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)

An attack in February 2019 saw users receive a file called "JobDetails.rar" which attempted to exploit the WinRAR vulnerability CVE-2018-20250.[\[3\]](https://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage)

Here's an excellent [writeup from Check Point](https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/extracting-code-execution-from-winrar/) covering a few WinRAR vulnerabilities including CVE-2018-20250. The vulnerability is a path traversal vulnerability that could allow a malicious actor to extract files to a different location than the target directory, such as to `C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`. The vulnerability only applies to .ace archives, but WinRAR handles the archive not by its file extension, but by its magic bytes (in this case `0x2A 0x2A 0x41 0x42 0x45 0x2A 0x2A` (which converts to `**ACE**`)). This means an ACE archive could be disguised by giving it .rar extension, but WinRAR will still handle it as an ACE file.

It's important to note that ACE is proprietary and the only software that should create ACE files in WinACE, which is now considered abandonware. ACE fell out of popularity around 2001.  Any files, therefore, that are found with ACE magic bytes should be considered suspicious, particularly if their file extension is .rar.

Only WinRAR versions 5.61 and earlier are vulnerable.  The patch involved dropping support for ACE archives.[\[5\]](https://research.checkpoint.com/2019/extracting-code-execution-from-winrar/)

#### Detection Methods
Look for emails with attached .rar files.  If that .rar contains `0x2A 0x2A 0x41 0x42 0x45 0x2A 0x2A` (possibly beginning at 0x07 offset) then the file isn't actually a .rar and should be considered extremely suspicious.  Look for WinRAR activity.  If a WinRAR version of 5.61 or earlier is installed, update immediately.
